# data-dyna Repo Plan Control Plane

## Active Pack

- `docs/plan/data-dyna-autopilot_PLAN.md`
- `docs/plan/data-dyna-autopilot_STATUS.md`
- `docs/plan/data-dyna-autopilot_WORKSET.md`

## Current Active Slice

- `DD-P0-S1`

## Intended Handoff

- `execute-plan`

## Autopilot Transition Contract

- `master_plan/completed` -> `wave_plan` for the current active slice when extra wave planning is needed; otherwise `execute`.
- `wave_plan/completed` -> `execute` same slice.
- `execute/completed` -> `review` same slice; execution completion is not terminal.
- `review/completed` + accepted evidence -> write back `STATUS` / `WORKSET`, activate the next unchecked stage in `Stage Order`, then route to next `wave_plan` or `execute`.
- `review/continue` -> keep the same active slice and route to `execute` for residual in-scope work.
- `needs_replan` -> `replan` with `plan-creator`.
- `blocked` / `failed` -> stop and preserve blocker evidence in `STATUS`.
- `done` is reserved for full objective completion and repo-local closeout prompt surface only.

## Parser / Runtime Notes

- This is the single-root repo-local machine control plane for `data-dyna` autopilot work.
- Keep this README, the active `PLAN`, `STATUS`, and `WORKSET` aligned in the same writeback turn.
- Active-slice phase reports should use `stepId = DD-P0-S1` until the accepted review writeback activates the next slice.
- Skill-backed routed phases require tools that include at least `read` and `autopilot_report`.
- Do not ask whether to continue as the normal path; continuation is encoded through each slice's `done_when` / `stop_boundary`.
